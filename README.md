This project is for a beauty store and involves creating a landing page.

Firstly, I created a header containing links to 'Shop,' 'HowTo,' and 'Contact.'




For the hero section, I added a background image showcasing makeup.

Next, I created a section demonstrating how to apply makeup, explaining the steps briefly and enhancing women's beauty. I included images of women in this section.

Following that, there's a section on how to remove makeup, detailing the steps involved, and also featuring relevant images.

The final section covers how to take care of the face after removing makeup, with accompanying images.

Lastly, I designed a footer which includes the logo, copyright information, and a contact link.
